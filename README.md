# Determining Which Aircrafts Offer Lower Risk To Business Stakeholders
## Project Overview
* A detailed findings of which aircraft  would offer lower risk to shareholders as they take in this new venture.
* Cleaning the data to ensure there no missing values.
* Communicate insights using visualizations.
## Business Understanding
The goals for this project are:
* Analyze data from the National Transportation Safety Board from 1962 to 2023 that deal with aviation accidents.
* Find the shareholders what aircrafts offer low risks to invest in.
* Determine what aircrafts offer high risks to the investors.
* Provide information to the head of new aviation division on which aircrafts the shareholders should purchase.
Once these goals are met we can identify which aircrafts are suitable for any stakeholder to invest in with minimal loss and projections for profit in the future in the aviation industry.
## Data Understanding
The data  comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) which has information about aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023.

To load the dataset we use pandas library.

```python
import pandas as pd
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
df=pd.read_csv("AviationData.csv",encoding= "latin-1",low_memory=False)
df
```

88889 rows Ã— 31 columns
```

The data contains 31 columns, from this data we should be able to identify aircrafts that offer high and low risks to the shareholders.

This data contains missing values so my first step is to clean this data.

The only columns that don't contain missing values are Event.Id, Investigation.Type, Accident.Number and Event.Date

Since some of columns have large number of missing values we will drop the columns, such columns include:
* Air carrier
* Latitude
* Longitude
* FAR.Description
```python
#drop column containing large number of missing values which include  Air.carrier , Latitude  and many others.
df=df.drop(["Air.carrier","Latitude","Longitude","FAR.Description","Schedule","Aircraft.Category","Airport.Code","Airport.Name","Amateur.Built"],axis=1)
df
```
 
We can also drop  rows and fill in null values using mean, mode and median.

I dropped rows in columns containing  few missing values which include columns make, model, location and Country

I filled the  missing values in the rest of the categorical data such as Purpose of flight and Injury severity with mode.

For the numerical data I filled in the null values with the median of each respective column.

I also removed duplicates in the data using
```python
#check for  duplicates 
df.duplicated().any()
```
```python
True
```

Since duplicates were present, I went ahead and removed the duplicates using the code shown below.
```python
#removing duplicates
df.drop_duplicates(subset=["Event.Id","Investigation.Type","Accident.Number","Event.Date","Location","Country","Injury.Severity","Make","Model","Purpose.of.flight","Total.Fatal.Injuries","Total.Uninjured"],keep="first",inplace= True)
df
```

The number of duplicates was just two.
## Data Analysis

This is where I made  use of visualizations to generate insights for the business stakeholders.

Here, I am going to display the  visuals that I used in tableau.

![Top 10 Riskiest Aircrafts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc3f8fca-3649-43c8-a6fb-b65abf99258f)
This Bar chart shows the relationship between total fatal injuries and make.
## Observation
* The make with the highest number of fatalities is Cessna hence Cessna will offer high risks if shareholders were to invest in the aircraft.
   

![Top 10 Safest Aircrafts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c029dad-9ffa-4e66-8688-2d20173c12f0)
## Observation
* The safest aircraft as displayed by the bar chart is Boeing.
  
![Total Uninjured by Purpose Of Flight(1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/700ffe7f-0d7d-4e40-b4d5-3922e557534c)

This is  a bar chart showing the  relationship between purpose of flight and the number of uninjured passengers.
## Observation
* The most common reason for passengers to take flights is personal flights.
## Conclusion
* The most common type of aircraft used for travel is Cessna and it's also the riskiest since it has the highest number of fatalities among the aircraft.
* Boeing is the safest aircraft and I would advise the business shareholders to purchase the Boeing Aircraft since it offers low risk.
* The most common reason for travel is personal flights and so I  would recommend the shareholders to invest in personal flights with the Boeing aircraft.
* The weather condition mostly responsible for accidents or fatal injuries is VMC.
* Most accidents are due to human error since IMC has less number of Total fatal and serious injuries compared to VMC.
* Majority of the Injuries are non-fatal.
